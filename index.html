    <h1>Welcome to my website.</h1>

    <div>
        <p>I am a Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.wais.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">Web and
            Internet Science (WAIS)</a> Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science
        (ECS) at the University of Southampton.</p>

        <p>I am interested in addressing issues between people and their data. For example, my PhD
        focused on using recommender systems to help people manage the access to their location
        data. Currently I am interested in designing novel tools to visualise and tell stories about
        data.</p>

        <p>If you want to know more about what I do, please check my <a
            href="/publications">papers</a>!</p>

        <p>I did my PhD in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, under the
        supervision of <a href="https://tnhh.org">Dr Tristan Henderson</a> and <a
            href="https://sites.google.com/site/juanyeresearch/"> Dr Juan Ye</a>. Before joining the
        WAIS to work with <a href="http://elenasimperl.eu"> Prof Elena Simperl </a>, I worked as a
        Research Fellow in the Cyber Security Centre (CSC) at the De Montfort University,
        Leicester.</p>
