Welcome to my website.

I am a Research Fellow in the Cyber Security Centre (CSC), De Montfort
University, Leicester.

My research revolves around understanding and addressing issues, such as
usability and privacy, in the interaction between us and our data. My PhD
focused on applying machine-learning techniques to recommending location-privacy
preferences. My current research is about evaluating privacy metrics in
different scenarios, which gives us deeper understanding of the strengths and
suitability of privacy metrics.

Before joining the CSC, I did my PhD in the School of Computer Science at the
University of St Andrews, under the supervision of [Dr Tristan
Henderson]({{"https://tnhh.org"|absolute_url}}) and Dr [Juan
Ye]({{"https://sites.google.com/site/juanyeresearch/"|absolute_url}}).
