        <p>I am a Research Associate in the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/systems-algorithms-design-lab/">Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (SysAL)</a>, Dyson School of Design and Engineering at Imperial College London.</p>

        <p>I am interested in addressing issues between people and their data. For example, my PhD
        focused on using recommender systems to help people manage the access to their location
        data.</p>

        <p>I did my PhD in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, under the
        supervision of <a href="https://tnhh.org">Dr Tristan Henderson</a> and <a
            href="https://sites.google.com/site/juanyeresearch/"> Dr Juan Ye</a>. Before joining the
        SysAL to work with <a href="https://haddadi.github.io/"> Dr Hamed Haddadi </a>, I worked at the University of Southampton and De Montfort University,
